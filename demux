Entity Demux is
port(S: IN BIT;
    SEL0,SEL1: IN BIT;
    A,B,C,D: OUT BIT
    );
end Demux;
Architecture comportamento of Demux is 
begin
  A <= (S and (NOT SEL0) AND (NOT SEL1));
  B <= (S and (NOT SEL0) AND (NOT SEL1));
  C <= (S and (NOT SEL0) AND (NOT SEL1));
  D <= (S and (NOT SEL0) AND (NOT SEL1));
 end comportamento;

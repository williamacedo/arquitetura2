Entity DeNewMux12 is
port(S: IN BIT;
    SEL0,SEL1: IN BIT;
    A,B,C,D: OUT BIT
    );
end DeNewMux12;
Architecture comportamento of DeNewMux12 is 
begin
  A <= S and ((NOT SEL0) AND (NOT SEL1));
  B <= S and ((NOT SEL0) AND SEL1);
  C <= S and (SEL0 AND (NOT SEL1));
  D <= S and (SEL0 AND SEL1);
 end comportamento;
